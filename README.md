Education Site
This is my first Adobe Dreamweaver CC project.
It was single page template free to use.
First of all I created seperate HTML pages.
then I made navigation to work fine from main page to individual pages and reverse.
then I added footer to each page with nav bar.
then I changed all the images in index.html and all other html pages.
then I changed all the images from Style.css for slider and overview images.
then i changed all the images in gallery.
then I replaced all the dummy text with original text.
I changed the footer info.
My website was complete in 4 days from Sunday-Thursday 4-7Feb2018.
